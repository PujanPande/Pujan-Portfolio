                    ðŸ‘‹ About Me
                    Hi! I'm Pujan, a junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Lynchburg. Iâ€™m passionate about building practical, efficient solutions through code and continuously expanding my skills in software development.

                    I recently completed an internship where I gained real-world experience and sharpened my problem-solving, teamwork, and technical abilities. It was a valuable step in applying classroom knowledge to real projects.

                    As a student, I enjoy exploring areas like web development, algorithms, and software engineering. I often spend time working on personal projects, learning new technologies, and staying curious about how things work under the hood.

                    I'm actively looking for new opportunities to grow and contributeâ€”whether through internships, collaborative projects, or freelance work. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect or work together!
            </p>
